# Master-Data-Management

Master Data Management (MDM) with Databricks can be a game-changer for handling large-scale, distributed, and complex data across multiple sources. Since you're working with Databricks in a telecom environment, here's how MDM can fit into your architecture:  

---

### **1. Why Use Databricks for MDM?**  
Traditional MDM solutions often struggle with **scalability, real-time data integration, and AI-driven insights.** Databricks, with its **Lakehouse architecture**, solves these problems by:  
- **Unifying structured & unstructured data** (from Salesforce, OSS/BSS, Apigee, Kafka, etc.).  
- **Leveraging Delta Lake** for ACID transactions and versioning.  
- **Using ML & AI** for data matching, deduplication, and entity resolution.

### **2. MDM Components in Databricks**  

| **MDM Component**      | **How Databricks Supports It** |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Data Ingestion**     | Auto-loader, Kafka, Apigee APIs, Salesforce connectors |
| **Data Cleansing**     | Spark transformations, Delta Live Tables |
| **Entity Resolution**  | ML models for fuzzy matching, Dedupe using Spark NLP |
| **Golden Record Creation** | Delta Lake updates with Change Data Capture (CDC) |
| **Data Governance**    | Unity Catalog for access control & lineage tracking |
| **Real-time Processing** | Structured Streaming for low-latency updates |

---

### **3. MDM Implementation Flow**  

1. **Ingest raw data**  
   - Pull in data from Salesforce (Accounts, Sites, Services), Apigee APIs, and Kafka event streams.  
   - Store everything in **Bronze Tables (Raw Layer)** in Delta Lake.  

2. **Clean & Standardize**  
   - Use **Databricks SQL** & **Delta Live Tables** to remove duplicates, validate formats, and standardize fields.  
   - Example: Normalize telecom site addresses from different sources into a standard format.  

3. **Match & Merge Entities (Golden Record)**  
   - Apply **fuzzy matching ML models** to identify duplicate customers, sites, or services.  
   - Store deduplicated, verified records in **Silver Tables (Cleansed Layer)**.  

4. **Apply Data Governance & Lineage**  
   - Use **Unity Catalog** to manage access and track data lineage.  

5. **Expose as a Real-Time API**  
   - Serve the Golden Record as an API using **Databricks SQL Serverless + MLflow + Apigee**.  
   - Enable real-time updates with **Structured Streaming**.  

---

### **4. Example Use Case in Telecom**  
ðŸ”¹ **Problem:** Customer service reps in Salesforce see duplicate customer/site data due to multiple systems (CRM, billing, OSS).  
ðŸ”¹ **Solution with Databricks MDM:**  
   - Ingest customer/site data from Salesforce, billing, and network inventory.  
   - Use **ML-powered fuzzy matching** to deduplicate records.  
   - Expose a single **Golden Record API** for Salesforce via Apigee.  

---

### **5. Key Benefits of MDM on Databricks**  
âœ… **Scalable & Real-time:** Can handle billions of records with Delta Lake & Spark Streaming.  
âœ… **AI-Driven Matching:** Uses ML models for better deduplication than rule-based systems.  
âœ… **Unified View:** Combines data across Salesforce, OSS/BSS, and external sources.  
âœ… **Secure & Compliant:** Unity Catalog provides RBAC & data lineage for audits.
